# Average Grade Calculator

This C# console application calculates the average grade from 21 grades entered by the user. It ensures that each grade entered is within the valid range of 2.00 to 6.00.

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/average-grade-calculator.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd average-grade-calculator
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Application**:
   - Open the solution file (`AverageGradeCalculator.sln`) in Visual Studio.
   - Build and run the project using Visual Studio.
   - Alternatively, run the application directly from the command line:
     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```

4. **Enter Grades**:
   - Follow the prompts to enter 21 grades. Each grade must be between 2.00 and 6.00.
   - If you enter an invalid grade, you will be prompted to enter it again.

5. **View Average Grade**:
   - Once all 21 valid grades are entered, the application calculates and displays the average grade with two decimal places.
